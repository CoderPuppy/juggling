  levels
    explicit
      objects are sets of props in position
      morphisms are animations of these props

  characterize prop selection
    in terms of iteration index and simultaneous index
    use per-cycle prop indices
    per-cycle prop index = iteration index + simultaneous index

  SVG animate!

  the objects can't have the props positions at the current time
  because then it would be impossible to define a functor from the siteswap category
  but they could be a multiset of positions at relative times

  layers
    animation
      objects are (products of) prop positions at relative times
      morphisms are passage of time plus animation of the props
        sequence of (relative) time of animation start plus animation
        then extra time passage

      optimized for rendering
    low

  segments are categories
    they should all be nearly symmetric monoidal
      nearly because morphisms must be of equal length
    and nearly skeletal
      because the core cannot contain any throws
  loops are the total space of endomorphisms
    these can have some optimizations

  how can points be shared between throws?

  animation segments
    full functor to Bℝ≥0 with a section `wait₀`
    (nearly) symmetric monoidal category
      nearly strict
    object generators are positions and relative times
    wait : Bℝ≥0 → Cat/Bℝ≥0
    wait(*) = Anim
    wait(t)(time, pos) = (time + t, pos)
